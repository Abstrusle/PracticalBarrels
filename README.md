# Practical Barrels

## About

Practical Barrels is a fully-clientside Fabric-based Minecraft mod designed to offer a unique sorting mechanism for barrels (and certain inventories named 'Barrel', if desperate).

The new functionalities include:

- Right-clicking an empty barrel inserts whatever is in your main hand, and all other items in your inventory of that type.
- If the barrel contains an item you're holding, right-clicking the barrel imports all of that item (immediately closing the window).
- An added button allows the player to insert all items related to those in the barrel inventory at once.
