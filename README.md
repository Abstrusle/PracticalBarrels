# Practical Barrels

## About

Practical Barrels is a fully-clientside Fabric-based Minecraft mod designed to offer a unique sorting mechanism for barrels (and certain inventories named 'Barrel', if desperate).

The new functionalities include:

- Right-clicking an empty barrel inserts whatever is in your main hand, and all other items in your inventory of that type.
- If the barrel contains an item you're holding, right-clicking the barrel imports all of that item (immediately closing the window).
- An added button allows the player to insert all items related to those in the barrel inventory at once.

The 1.17 jar is compatible with both 1.17 and 1.18. For 1.19, Modmenu and the Cloth API are required to load the configuration menu in-game.
